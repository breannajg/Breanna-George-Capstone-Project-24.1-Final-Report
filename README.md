# **AI/ML Repository Analysis and Prediction Dashboard**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes trending GitHub repositories in AI/ML-related fields (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, etc.) and predicts potential growth in terms of stars and watchers over the next six months. The project provides:
1. A list of the **Top 10 most popular AI/ML repositories** based on current star count.
2. Predictions of the **Top 10 emerging AI/ML repositories** using time-series modeling and logarithmic growth simulation.

The visualized results are presented as interactive dashboards.

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection**:
   - The GitHub REST API is used to fetch repositories matching AI/ML keywords.
   - Data such as stars, watchers, language, and last updated time are collected.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Repositories are filtered to exclude certain languages (e.g., HTML).
   - Repositories are sorted by their current star count to identify the most popular ones.
   - Logarithmic growth and Exponential Smoothing are applied to simulate future star and watcher counts.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Two bubble charts are generated:
     - **Top 10 Current Popular AI/ML Repositories**.
     - **Top 10 Predicted AI/ML Repositories**.
   - Each chart displays watchers (x-axis), stars (y-axis), and relative bubble sizes for clarity.
